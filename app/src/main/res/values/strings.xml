    <string name="action_settings">Settings</string>
    <string name="description">To calculate custom duty, your duty is calculated based on summing up the following: surface duty (% of CIF), surcharge, administrative charge (CISS), ECOWAS Trade Liberalization Scheme (ETLS), and 5% VAT.
        \n\n Lets take an Example, if Total Goods cost + Shipping fees = #4,400,000

        \n\nFOB + Freight and Insurance cost = CIF which is #4,400,000 in your case.
\n\nSurface duty (35% of #4,400,000) = #1,540,000
\n\nSurcharge (7% of #1,540,000 ) = #107,800
\n\nETLS (0.5% of #4,400,000) = #22,000
\n\nCISS (1% of #4,400,000) = #44,000
\n\nVAT (5% of all above) = 85,690
\n\nTotal duty payable =  #1,799,490. </string>
